# EM-modelling-framework
This framework needs to be used in conjunction with a modelling code. 
Currently it works with the GdfidL EM modelling code, but is being extended to include ECHO3D. 
It allows the setting up of parameter sweeps and post processes the output.
The geometry can be defined either using GdfidL primatives or using an STL file.
STL files can be programatically generated by this code and the FreeCAD software.
