# EM-modelling-framework
This framework needs to be used in conjunction with a modelling code. 
Currently it works with the GdfidL EM modelling code. 
It allows the setting up of parameter sweeps and post processes the output.
The geometry can be defined either using GdfidL primatives or using an STL file.
STL files can be programatically generated by code in https://github.com/alunmorgan/EM_CAD_frontend and the FreeCAD software.
